= crux-redis

This project contains `RedisKv` which is an implementation of `kv/KvStore`,
usable for remote index-store indexes (unlike RocksDB or LMDB which must be locally embedded in the Crux node).

ALPHA - do not use in production.

All tests are passing.

Limited to <1 billion source triples due to 32-bit Redis single-node index limits. Limits are not tracked.

For tests, see `/test/crux_redis/kv_test.clj`.
